OpenAI Function Calling

	We can pass user-defined functions to open ai's API. When we pass prompts to the API, we will now receive what function the model has determined to use, and what arguments to pass to that function

Langchain expression language (LCEL)

	A lot of power for langchain comes from composing different chains together.

	LCEL makes it easy by providing custom easy-to-use expressive syntax

Pydantic

	Pydantic is a data validation library for python. Works with python type annotations. But rather than static type checking, they are actively used at runtime for data validation and conversion.

	Pydantic data classes are a blend of Python's data classes with the validation power of Pydantic. 

	They offer a concise way to define data structures while ensuring that the data adheres to specified types and constraints.

Tagging and extraction

	This allows us from extracting structured data from unstructured text

Tools and Routing

	A tool is a langchain construct which allows you to define a pydantic schema, use open-ai function calling, as well as call those functions

Conversational agent (GPT-4 with Microsoft Bing)

	Agents are a combination of LLM and code. LLMs reason about what steps to take and call for actions.

	Agent loop: choose a langchain tool to use, observe the output of the tool, repeat until a stopping condition is met

	Stopping conditions: LLM determined (or) Hardcoded rules
